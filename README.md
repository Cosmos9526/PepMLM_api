# PepMLM_api
PepMLM is a machine learning-based model for generating short peptide sequences that can act as binders to target proteins. Given a protein sequence and a set of parameters, PepMLM predicts peptide binders and returns them ranked by a pseudo-perplexity score, allowing you to identify promising peptides for further validation.
